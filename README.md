# Matiks_Actionable_Insights

## Project Background:

Matiks is building the destination for competitive cognitive play. It design fast, skill-based games that test and celebrate mental agility. With thousands of users already engaging in real-time challenges, they are creating a new category at the intersection of gaming, performance and social platforms - where your mind is your edge.

**Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:**

1. Revenue Trends (Weekly):

       Revenue has mostly ranged between $3K and $6K, with a notable peak at $7K around late November 2023.

       There's a recent decline to $3K in June 2025, which may need further investigation.

2. User Activity Trends:
   
       -Day-wise Activity: Daily active users hover between 300‚Äì400, peaking at 403 users on April 23(2025), but generally fluctuating.

       -Week-wise Activity: Weekly sign-ins peaked at 2,397 users (week of May 4,2025), then dropped to 1,293 by mid-May(2025).

       -Month-wise Activity: The pie chart suggests the usage of the month April and May, likely split between high-activity in the month of May(~6,972) and low-activity in the     month of April(~3,028) users.
3. Device Type & Game Mode Revenue Breakdown:
   
       -Highest revenue from:
   
        PC Co-op ($59K)
   
        Mobile Multiplayer ($58K)

   **Recommendations:**

   Double Down on Mobile Multiplayer
   Mobile Multiplayer is strong ($58K) ‚Äî invest in:

       Game enhancements specific to this mode.

       Targeted marketing campaigns to attract similar users.

       Referral or reward programs to boost multiplayer adoption.
   
   Given PC Co-op generates highest revenue ($59K), consider:

       Adding new levels/features.

       Creating content bundles or subscriptions.

       Leveraging streamers/influencers on PC platforms to boost visibility.

   Reactivate Lapsing Users:

       Segment by session time, in-game actions, or spend.

       Personalize offers (e.g., discounts for low-engagement users, loyalty bonuses for high-engagement ones).
